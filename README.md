 I chose between JODI and Frider Nake, both artists whose work is interesting and worth further study.
Nake believes that computers should not be used to imitate other artistic styles but should inspire people to think about new situations and relationships and even make people forget the concept of "art."
JODI was founded in 1995 in the early days of the Internet. Their artistic practice is characterized by chaos and non-functional design, revealing the essential characteristics of the Internet. One of their most famous works is **www.jodi.org**, which consists of a maze of HTML code pages full of dead ends but seemingly hiding secrets. For example, the homepage is a garbled code with green text on a black background. Only when you look at the page's source code can you find that these symbols are pieced together to form an image of a nuclear bomb? Due to its chaotic and misleading design, this website is often regarded as the work of hackers. Through this chaos and confusion, JODI reveals the Internet's potential dangers, the information hidden in the code, and how users can be misled.
     In the end, I chose Frider Nake.
In his works, the seemingly chaotic arrangement of lines is exciting - sometimes they gather, sometimes they separate from each other, but there seems to be some pattern in the chaos.
Nake believes that art (or, more precisely, "aesthetic objects") is only secondary and incidental, not a goal that must be created. He believes that aesthetic information (the sensory experience brought by art) mainly attracts the rich and the ruling class. At the same time, for most ordinary people, it is just part of the information and does not have independent importance. Therefore, he advocates that computer art should be regarded as part of the study of information dissemination, not just to create aesthetic works. Nake is cautious and even critical of computer art, believing it should not be just visual innovation but have more profound social and information value.
In today's era of rapid information development, our lives have become more convenient, but the dissemination of information has also brought greater risks. Our data may be accidentally leaked to the Internet, which is worth pondering.
      The work is generated based on computer algorithms and rules. It uses mathematics and program control to create unique visual effects, rather than traditional hand-painted or intuitive creation methods.
From a particular perspective, it can be classified as a "data-generated image" because it may be generated by a mathematical function or set of parameters.
This is a computer-generated geometric abstract art, like the work of Frider Nake or other early computer artists. The work shows procedurally generated lines, grids, and shapes, which look like a computer-controlled drawing process.
Possible meaning: Exploring the role of computers in art: This type of work studies how computers generate visual aesthetics, emphasizing procedural creation and automated design.
Combination of rules and randomness: There are regular straight lines, interlaced lines, and geometric shapes in the picture, but it also contains some distorted areas, which may symbolize changes or interventions under algorithmic control.
Information visualization or mathematical experiment: The work may be generated based on mathematical functions, geometric divisions, or data mapping.
Artist's creative motivation:
Study how computers generate images and explore the differences between this and traditional art creation methods.
Trying to break the boundaries of human-dominated artistic creation and raise the question of "whether art requires human intervention."
Influenced by 20th-century modernist art (such as constructivism and concrete art) and information aesthetics, it hopes to create new visual experiences through computers.
       The core of generative art: setting rules
The core of generative art lies in rules. Artists design algorithms and set rules, and computers or systems generate works according to these rules.
These rules can include mathematical formulas, logical operations, random processes, and even artificial intelligence decision-making systems.
Galanter believes that generative art is a rule-based art form that uses algorithms, mathematical systems, or other structured methods to create works. He defines generative art as "art created by systems that operate autonomously to a certain extent," which is highly consistent with the idea of "creating art through rules."
Frider Nake, Vera MolnÃ¡r, and Harold Cohen are all exploring how to create visual art through rules and algorithms. This article fits well with the theme of "art created through rules." It explores how art is generated through rules and delves into computer art's philosophy, technology, and aesthetics.
