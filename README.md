 I chose between JODI and Frider Nake, both artists whose work is interesting and worth further study. Nake believes that computers should not be used to imitate other artistic styles but should inspire people to think about new situations and relationships and even make people forget the concept of "art."
JODI was founded in 1995 in the early days of the Internet. Their artistic practice is characterized by chaos and non-functional design, revealing the essential characteristics of the Internet. One of their most famous works is www.jodi.org, which consists of a maze of HTML code pages full of dead ends but seemingly hiding secrets. For example, the homepage is a garbled code with green text on a black background. Only when you look at the page's source code can you find that these symbols are pieced together to form an image of a nuclear bomb. Due to its chaotic and misleading design, this website is often regarded as the work of hackers. Through this chaos and confusion, JODI reveals the Internet's potential dangers, the information hidden in the code, and how users can be misled. In the end, I chose Frider Nake.
In his works, the seemingly chaotic arrangement of lines is exciting - sometimes they gather, sometimes they separate from each other, but there seems to be some pattern in the chaos.
According to Nake, art functions as an adjunct rather than an essential concept that needs production. According to Nake, aesthetic information functions primarily as an attraction force for social elites and members of the ruling class. Instead of holding individual significance, the sensory experience remains as one part of information for ordinary people. He supports treating computer art within the scope of information dissemination research instead of limiting it to aesthetic creation. Computer art requires caution to Nake because it represents visual creativity but needs higher social relevance and information depth.
In today's era of rapid information development, our lives have become more convenient, but the dissemination of information has also brought greater risks. Our data may be accidentally leaked to the Internet, which is worth pondering. The work is generated based on computer algorithms and rules. It uses mathematics and program control to create unique visual effects, rather than traditional hand-painted or intuitive creation methods.
Some regard this image as "data-generated" since its creation uses mathematical rules and equations. This artwork represents digital geometric abstraction, just like the creations of Frider Nake and other pioneering computer artists. The work displays visually random lines, grids, and shapes produced by a programmed computer drawing process. This field studies what computers can produce visually through automated design while using computer-driven manufacturing methods. The artwork uses both programmed shape patterns and unpredictable distortions to display adjustments possibly made by algorithmic systems. The work derives computer output from mathematical formulas and space layering plus information processing. Research the ways computers make digital images compared to classic methods of making art. The work attempts to redefine limits on artists' control by investigating if artistic production needs human participation at all. Through 20th-century modernist painting styles, including constructivism and concrete art, the artistic movement tries to make new visual effects by using computers.
The core of generative art lies in rules. Artists design algorithms and set rules, and computers or systems generate works according to these rules. These rules can include mathematical formulas, logical operations, random processes, and even artificial intelligence decision-making systems. A generative art form is a rule-based art that produces works by using algorithms, mathematical systems, or other rule-based methods. He defines generative art as "art created by systems that operate autonomously to a certain extent," which is highly consistent with the idea of "creating art through rules." All of them are seeking how to make visual art with rules and algorithms: Frider Nake, Vera Molnár, and Harold Cohen. Overall, this article seamlessly fits the theme of “art created under rules.” It discusses computer art's philosophy, technology, and aesthetics and its exploration of how art is generated through the rules. In A Companion to Digital Art, Philip Galanter focuses on the theoretical basis of generative art, especially rule systems, as the basis for artistic creation. The dominant form of generative art is algorithmic works that create new art based on algorithms, mathematical formulas, or some form of randomness, which transforms the tasks of the artist from intuitive to that of a system designer. Between this and other ancillary parameters, artists can indirectly affect the results without direct control over the details. Blurring the line between artists and tools and viewing art as a product of process, this creative mode has artificially blurred the difference between art and tool.
Galanter combines generative art with complexity science (such as chaos theory and emergence) to explore how simple rules produce unpredictable, complex forms. This "balance of order and disorder" challenges the "harmony" standard of traditional aesthetics and focuses on the inherent logic of dynamic systems. In addition, the technological dependence of generative art makes it naturally interdisciplinary and democratizing. Open source code and algorithm sharing can break the elite monopoly of art production and encourage the public to participate in creation.
According to Galanter's work, rules at the base level determine what artists can create through computational art. The probability model manages visual objects at random points while fractals emerge from repeated acts of computation. Computational art finds beauty in system changes during the production phase rather than in the traditional art's final state. The rules in interactive generative art systems change automatically when an audience starts interacting with them, while bio-simulation algorithms display natural-looking self-forming behaviors The new role of artists involves structuring machine outputs when they select variants that match their vision instead of remaining creators. Set boundaries create order in art creation, but absolute confidence produces robotic patterns until randomness enters to release restricted design from its pattern.
In computational art, rules are the "metalanguage" of art. Rules define boundaries of possibilities of creation, and that's where the core of things lies, no matter what code you are writing. So, for instance, a probability distribution can dictate how elements of the visual are to be randomized, or recursive algorithms can produce fractal structures. Such a rule-based creation method does away with the creation of art as a static end product, in turn making art a dynamic evolutionary process.
The aesthetic value of dynamic systems is reflected in computational art's emphasis on process and evolution rather than the "finished state" of traditional art. For instance, in terms of generating something interactive and generative, the rules can be adjusted in real-time on the input of the audience, or in the case of bio-simulation algorithms, the output can show life-like self-organizing behavior. Computational art is a typical visual experiment in which the path of evolution is uncertain and depends on a worldwide participant in its production, this variability and interactivity make computational art an evolving visual experiment.
This creative approach promotes building new ways for artists to exist as curators and collaborators along with their original status as creators. Instead, creators need to select among desired outcomes or partner with computers while understanding their power limits. A human-machine collaborative tool merges artistic roles between artists and machines. Such practice follows a regular pattern.
Computational art creates essential links between rules and the lack of control through its fundamental aspects. The system functions well, yet constant control produces robotic results that introduce random chaos and release the rules to show delightful surprises. An ideal mix of rules and randomness creates an excellent foundation for modern art production by algorithms. The rules form the essential structure of generative art that controls the creation process and its different outcomes across time. Nake creates "Hommage à Paul Klee" using linear algebra formulas to control color and line generation in the program. According to Galanter, "emergent art" creates sophisticated group patterns based on basic operational guidelines such as the Boids bird pattern generator.
Explicit rules:
These are the most direct rules, like a written "instruction manual." For example, a fractal pattern is drawn using a mathematical formula, or a painting is generated using the code of a neural network. These rules are written and directly determine the appearance of the work.
Implicit rules:
These are rules hidden in the system, not written directly, but generated through interaction. For example, the audience's behavior (such as clicking on the screen or moving the body) will affect the generated results of the artwork. These rules are the "invisible hand" that quietly guides the changes in the work.
The metaphor of rules for society
The rule system of generative art can be seen as a metaphor for real society:
Society has many rules, such as laws, systems, and cultural habits, which control our lives, like code.
Generative art makes us think: Do these rules make us freer or more controlled? For example, algorithmic recommendations allow us to see more content we like, but will it also limit our vision?
The challenge of rules to traditional art
Transparency:
The rules of generative art (such as code) can be made public, and anyone can see and modify them. This breaks the myth that "artists are the only creators" in traditional art, and art is no longer something "scarce" or "mysterious."
From "aesthetics" to "logic sense":
Traditional art makes people appreciate its beauty, while generative art makes people pay more attention to its logic. For example, the audience looks at the painting and wants to know "how this painting is generated with code." Art has changed from "looking at the result" to "understanding the process."
From "eternity" to "instantaneity":
Traditional art is usually fixed (such as a painting hanging on the wall), while generative art can constantly change. For example, the pattern on the screen will change in real time over time or with the audience's interaction, and art has become a "living" process rather than a "dead" result.

I am researching how to transform abstract rules into a form that is perceptible to the audience (such as allowing the audience to adjust the generation rules in real-time through parameter slides).

# improving 
i asked chat gpt how to improve it
chatgpt told me to add:
1.Color flow: Line and text colors change over time and maintain complementary color relationships
2.Organic movement: Lines drift slowly like water plants, and interact when the mouse approaches
3.Ambient glow: There is a soft colored glow around the mouse, and superimposed particles enhance details
4.Depth level: Create depth of field effect through translucent superposition

code that i add 

you can change the numbers to see differnt changings on the canvas
```
const CONFIG = {
  LINE_COUNT: 80,         
  TEXT_COUNT: 150,        
  MAX_SPEED: 2,          
  GLOW_SIZE: 200,         
  COLOR_SPEED: 0.7        
};
```

hsb colour( this is from chat gpt)
Using hue values in p5.js is a powerful way to create vibrant and dynamic color schemes. In p5.js, the colorMode() function allows you to switch to HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) mode, which is more intuitive for working with colors in creative coding. Here's a detailed guide on how to use hue values effectively:
1. Setting Up HSB Mode
By default, p5.js uses RGB (Red, Green, Blue) mode. To switch to HSB mode, use the colorMode()

```
let hueValue = 0; /

function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100); 
  strokeWeight(2);
}

function draw() {
  background(0, 0, 95); 
  
  
  hueValue = (hueValue + 0.5) % 360;
  
  
  linesArray.forEach(lineObj => {
    let lineHue = (hueValue + random(-30, 30)) % 360;
    stroke(lineHue, 80, 70, 50); 
    line(lineObj.x1, lineObj.y1, lineObj.x2, lineObj.y2);
  });

 
  fill((hueValue + 180) % 360, 50, 100, 80); 
  // 
}
```
Make lines and text flow:

```
// 在 generateNew() 
function generateNew() {
  linesArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) { 
    linesArray.push({
      x1: random(width),
      y1: random(height),
      x2: random(width),
      y2: random(height),
      vx: random(-1, 1), // 
      vy: random(-1, 1)  // 
    });
  }
}

// 在 draw() 
function draw() {
 
  
 
  linesArray.forEach(lineObj => {
    lineObj.x1 += lineObj.vx;
    lineObj.y1 += lineObj.vy;
    lineObj.x2 += lineObj.vx * 0.5; 
    lineObj.y2 += lineObj.vy * 0.5;
    
    // 边界反弹
    if (lineObj.x1 < 0 || lineObj.x1 > width) lineObj.vx *= -1;
    if (lineObj.y1 < 0 || lineObj.y1 > height) lineObj.vy *= -1;
  });
}
```

mouth control

```
function mouseMoved() {
 
  linesArray.forEach(lineObj => {
    let d = dist(mouseX, mouseY, lineObj.x1, lineObj.y1);
    if (d < 100) {
      lineObj.vx += (mouseX - lineObj.x1) * 0.01;
      lineObj.vy += (mouseY - lineObj.y1) * 0.01;
    }
  });
}

function doubleClicked() {
  generateNew();
}
```
