 I chose between JODI and Frider Nake, both artists whose work is interesting and worth further study.
Nake believes that computers should not be used to imitate other artistic styles but should inspire people to think about new situations and relationships and even make people forget the concept of "art."

JODI was founded in 1995 in the early days of the Internet. Their artistic practice is characterized by chaos and non-functional design, revealing the essential characteristics of the Internet. One of their most famous works is **www.jodi.org**, which consists of a maze of HTML code pages full of dead ends but seemingly hiding secrets. For example, the homepage is a garbled code with green text on a black background. Only when you look at the page's source code can you find that these symbols are pieced together to form an image of a nuclear bomb? Due to its chaotic and misleading design, this website is often regarded as the work of hackers. Through this chaos and confusion, JODI reveals the Internet's potential dangers, the information hidden in the code, and how users can be misled.
     In the end, I chose Frider Nake.
     
In his works, the seemingly chaotic arrangement of lines is exciting - sometimes they gather, sometimes they separate from each other, but there seems to be some pattern in the chaos.

Nake believes that art (or, more precisely, "aesthetic objects") is only secondary and incidental, not a goal that must be created. He believes that aesthetic information (the sensory experience brought by art) mainly attracts the rich and the ruling class. At the same time, for most ordinary people, it is just part of the information and does not have independent importance. Therefore, he advocates that computer art should be regarded as part of the study of information dissemination, not just to create aesthetic works. Nake is cautious and even critical of computer art, believing it should not be just visual innovation but have more profound social and information value.

In today's era of rapid information development, our lives have become more convenient, but the dissemination of information has also brought greater risks. Our data may be accidentally leaked to the Internet, which is worth pondering.
      The work is generated based on computer algorithms and rules. It uses mathematics and program control to create unique visual effects, rather than traditional hand-painted or intuitive creation methods.
      
From a particular perspective, it can be classified as a "data-generated image" because it may be generated by a mathematical function or set of parameters.
This is a computer-generated geometric abstract art, like the work of Frider Nake or other early computer artists. The work shows procedurally generated lines, grids, and shapes, which look like a computer-controlled drawing process.
  Exploring the role of computers in art: This type of work studies how computers generate visual aesthetics, emphasizing procedural creation and automated design.
Combination of rules and randomness: There are regular straight lines, interlaced lines, and geometric shapes in the picture, but it also contains some distorted areas, which may symbolize changes or interventions under algorithmic control.
Information visualization or mathematical experiment: The work may be generated based on mathematical functions, geometric divisions, or data mapping.
Study how computers generate images and explore the differences between this and traditional art creation methods.
Trying to break the boundaries of human-dominated artistic creation and raise the question of "whether art requires human intervention."
Influenced by 20th-century modernist art (such as constructivism and concrete art) and information aesthetics, it hopes to create new visual experiences through computers.

The core of generative art lies in rules. Artists design algorithms and set rules, and computers or systems generate works according to these rules.
These rules can include mathematical formulas, logical operations, random processes, and even artificial intelligence decision-making systems.Generative art is a rule-based art form that uses algorithms, mathematical systems, or other structured methods to create works. He defines generative art as "art created by systems that operate autonomously to a certain extent," which is highly consistent with the idea of "creating art through rules."
Frider Nake, Vera Molnár, and Harold Cohen are all exploring how to create visual art through rules and algorithms. This article fits well with the theme of "art created through rules." It explores how art is generated through rules and delves into computer art's philosophy, technology, and aesthetics.
Philip Galanter explores the theoretical basis of generative art in A Companion to Digital Art, emphasizing the central role of rule systems in artistic creation. Generative art generates works through algorithms, mathematical formulas, or random mechanisms, transforming the role of artists from "intuition-driven" creators to system designers. Artists indirectly affect the results by adjusting parameters rather than directly controlling the details. This creative mode blurs the boundaries between "artists" and "tools" and regards art as the product of a dynamic process.

Galanter combines generative art with complexity science (such as chaos theory and emergence) to explore how simple rules produce unpredictable, complex forms. This "balance of order and disorder" challenges the "harmony" standard of traditional aesthetics and focuses on the inherent logic of dynamic systems. In addition, the technological dependence of generative art makes it naturally interdisciplinary and democratizing. Open source code and algorithm sharing can break the elite monopoly of art production and encourage the public to participate in creation.

From Galanter's text, you will learn the following new knowledge about computational art:
Rules as the "metalanguage" of art: The core of computational art is not the code itself but how the rules define the boundaries of creation possibilities. For example, a probability distribution can control the random distribution of visual elements, or fractal structures can be generated by recursive algorithms.
The aesthetic value of dynamic systems: Computational art emphasizes process and evolution rather than the "finished state" of traditional art. For example, interactive generative art adjusts rules in real-time based on audience input, or bio-simulation algorithms show life-like self-organizing behavior.
Reconstruction of the artist's identity: Artists change from "creators" to "curators" or "collaborators" and need to select variants that meet their intentions from a large number of generated results or co-create with machines and accept the uncontrollability of algorithms.
The dialectical relationship between rules and loss of control: rules provide structure, but excessive certainty leads to mechanical repetition; introducing randomness or chaotic parameters can break rigidity and produce "unexpected beauty."

In computational art, **rules are the "metalanguage" of art**. The core lies not in the code itself but in how the rules define the boundaries of creation possibilities. For example, a probability distribution can control the random distribution of visual elements, while recursive algorithms can generate fractal structures. This rule-based creation method makes art no longer a static result but a dynamic evolutionary process.

**The aesthetic value of dynamic systems** is reflected in computational art's emphasis on process and evolution rather than the "finished state" of traditional art. For example, interactive generative art can adjust rules in real-time based on audience input, while bio-simulation algorithms can show life-like self-organizing behavior. This variability and interactivity make computational art an evolving visual experiment.

This creative mode also prompts **the reconstruction of the identity of artists who are no longer simply "creators" but more like "curators" or "collaborators." They need to select variants that meet their intentions from many generated results or co-create with machines and accept the uncontrollability of algorithms. This human-machine collaborative approach blurs the boundaries between traditional artists and tools.

overall， the dialectical relationship between **rules and loss of control** in computational art is crucial. Rules provide structure, but excessive certainty may lead to mechanical repetition while introducing randomness or chaotic parameters can break the rigidity and create "unexpected beauty." This balance between order and disorder allows generative art to breed unlimited creativity within the framework of rules.
Core argument: Rules are the "DNA" of generative art, which determines the form, variation, and evolution potential of the work. For example, Nake's "Hommage à Paul Klee" defines the generation logic of colors and lines through linear algebra formulas. At the same time, the "emergent art" mentioned by Galanter generates complex group behaviors through simple rules (such as the Boids algorithm for bird flock simulation).

I am researching on how to transform abstract rules into a form that is perceptible to the audience (such as allowing the audience to adjust the generation rules in real time through parameter sliders).

# improving 
i asked chat gpt how to improve it
chatgpt told me to add:
1.Color flow: Line and text colors change over time and maintain complementary color relationships
2.Organic movement: Lines drift slowly like water plants, and interact when the mouse approaches
3.Ambient glow: There is a soft colored glow around the mouse, and superimposed particles enhance details
4.Depth level: Create depth of field effect through translucent superposition

code that i add 

you can change the numbers to see differnt changings on the canvas
```
const CONFIG = {
  LINE_COUNT: 80,         
  TEXT_COUNT: 150,        
  MAX_SPEED: 2,          
  GLOW_SIZE: 200,         
  COLOR_SPEED: 0.7        
};
```

hsb colour( this is from chat gpt)
Using hue values in p5.js is a powerful way to create vibrant and dynamic color schemes. In p5.js, the colorMode() function allows you to switch to HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) mode, which is more intuitive for working with colors in creative coding. Here's a detailed guide on how to use hue values effectively:
1. Setting Up HSB Mode
By default, p5.js uses RGB (Red, Green, Blue) mode. To switch to HSB mode, use the colorMode()

```
let hueValue = 0; /

function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100); 
  strokeWeight(2);
}

function draw() {
  background(0, 0, 95); 
  
  
  hueValue = (hueValue + 0.5) % 360;
  
  
  linesArray.forEach(lineObj => {
    let lineHue = (hueValue + random(-30, 30)) % 360;
    stroke(lineHue, 80, 70, 50); 
    line(lineObj.x1, lineObj.y1, lineObj.x2, lineObj.y2);
  });

 
  fill((hueValue + 180) % 360, 50, 100, 80); 
  // 
}
```
Make lines and text flow:

```
// 在 generateNew() 
function generateNew() {
  linesArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) { 
    linesArray.push({
      x1: random(width),
      y1: random(height),
      x2: random(width),
      y2: random(height),
      vx: random(-1, 1), // 
      vy: random(-1, 1)  // 
    });
  }
}

// 在 draw() 
function draw() {
 
  
 
  linesArray.forEach(lineObj => {
    lineObj.x1 += lineObj.vx;
    lineObj.y1 += lineObj.vy;
    lineObj.x2 += lineObj.vx * 0.5; 
    lineObj.y2 += lineObj.vy * 0.5;
    
    // 边界反弹
    if (lineObj.x1 < 0 || lineObj.x1 > width) lineObj.vx *= -1;
    if (lineObj.y1 < 0 || lineObj.y1 > height) lineObj.vy *= -1;
  });
}
```

mouth control

```
function mouseMoved() {
 
  linesArray.forEach(lineObj => {
    let d = dist(mouseX, mouseY, lineObj.x1, lineObj.y1);
    if (d < 100) {
      lineObj.vx += (mouseX - lineObj.x1) * 0.01;
      lineObj.vy += (mouseY - lineObj.y1) * 0.01;
    }
  });
}

function doubleClicked() {
  generateNew();
}
```
